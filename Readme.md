# Fabric is Magic
The goal of this repo is to provide a fun way to learn Mcirosoft Fabric using Magic the Gathering data.

In order to get started, you'll need to set up a Fabic trial. Andy Leonard as a [blog post](https://andyleonard.blog/2023/11/start-fabric-free-trial/) on that.

If you know nothing about Magic the gathering drafting, [this video](https://youtu.be/6y3zF5bTEsM) is an interesting view into the data.
